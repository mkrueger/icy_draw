        SAUCE &ndash; Standard Architecture for Universal Comment Extensions</h1>
    <address class="author">
        by Olivier "Tasmaniac" Reubens / ACiD</address>
    <p>
        The Standard Architecture for Universal Comment Extensions or SAUCE as it is more
        commonly known, is an architecture or protocol for attaching meta data or comments
        to files. Mainly intended for ANSI art files, SAUCE has always had provisions for
        many different file types.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Why SAUCE?</h2>
    <p>
        In the early 1990s there was a growing popularity in ANSI artwork. The ANSI art
        groups regularly released the works of their members over a certain period. Some
        of the bigger groups also included specialised viewers in each &lsquo;artpack&rsquo;.
        One of the problems with these artpacks was a lack of standardized way to provide
        meta data to the art, such as the title of the artwork, the author, the group, ...
        Some of the specialised viewers provided such information for a specific artpack
        either by encoding it as part of the executable, or by having some sort of database
        or list. However every viewer did it their own way. This meant you either had to
        use the viewer included with the artpack, or had to make do without the extra info.
        SAUCE was created to address that need. So if you wanted to, you could use your
        prefered viewer to view the art in a certain artpack, or even store the art files
        you liked in a separate folder while retaining the meta data.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal was simple, but the way to get there certainly was not. Logistically, we
        wanted as many art groups as possible to support it. Technically, we wanted a system
        that was easy to implement and &ndash; if at all possible &ndash; manage to provide
        this meta data while still being compatible with all the existing software such
        as ANSI viewers, and Bulletin Board Software.
    </p>
    <h2>
        The SAUCE Legacy</h2>
    <p>
        SAUCE was created in 1994 and it continues to be in use today as a de facto standard
        within the ANSI art community. However, being created so many years ago, some of
        the common assumptions made back then are now cause for confusion. This document
        is a revised edition of the SAUCE specifications; slightly more formal and in a
        fresh HTML format. This specification is still compatible with the original, some
        of the legacy confusions are explicitly addressed, and a few new features have been
        added.
    </p>
    <p>
        The &lsquo;born from DOS&rsquo; nature explains some of the limits of SAUCE. The
        Title, Author and Group fields are so short because part of the original design
        idea was that the DOS filename, title and author needed to fit on a single line
        in text mode while still leaving some space so you could create a decent UI to select
        the files in the ANSI viewers. Limitations were also designed around what video
        cards could do in text mode.
        <br />
        The specialised viewers in the various ANSI artpacks also explain why it was possible
        to add SAUCE to some files even though the file format really does not like it when
        you just add a load of extra bytes at the end. The SAUCE-aware viewer could account
        for the SAUCE and still render the file properly, even if the applications used
        to edit those files regarded the file as corrupt. In such an event, it was easy
        enough to remove the SAUCE.
    </p>
    <p>
        SAUCE is not a perfect solution, but at the time &ndash; and with a bit of friendly
        pressure from the right folks &ndash; it managed to fulfill what it was designed
        to do.
    </p>
    <h2>
        SAUCE applied to a file
    </h2>
    <p>
        Applied to a file, SAUCE has 4 parts: The original file contents, an End-Of-File
        or EOF character (Decimal 26, Hex 1A, Ctrl+Z), an optional comment block and the
        SAUCE record.
    </p>
    <p>
        The EOF character is an important part of what makes SAUCE work for text files.
        When processing a text file, the DOS / Windows TYPE command, most BBS terminal software
        and ANSI-viewers will all stop processing at the end of the file or when a EOF character
        is encountered with the EOF character itself not being rendered.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Writing SAUCE to a file</h3>
    <p>
        Adding SAUCE to a file that does not already contain SAUCE is straightforward. First,
        you prepare the SAUCE record and optionally the comment block. You open the file
        you want to add SAUCE to, you append the EOF character, if needed you append the
        comment block and you append the SAUCE record.
    </p>
    <p>
        Updating a file that already has SAUCE, can be easy as well if you only want to
        change some fields in the SAUCE record or change existing comment lines. Things
        become slightly tricky if you want to add a comment block when there was no comment
        block before, or if the new comment block has a different number of lines than the
        old one. The simple solution in such a case is to remove the old SAUCE then add
        the new SAUCE you want. This involves truncating a file, which depending on the
        language / library / OS can be a matter of a simple function call, or might involve
        copying the file contents without the SAUCE to a new file.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Reading SAUCE from a file
    </h3>
    <p>
        Reading SAUCE is equally easy. Read the last 128 bytes of the file into a SAUCE
        record structure. If the ID is set to "SAUCE", then you can assume you have a file
        that has SAUCE otherwise it does not. If you need the comment block as well, then
        once you have the SAUCE record, you can check the Comment field and work your way
        back to read the comment block.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below you find some pseudo code to explain this. This code assumes a language that
        can not handle variable records, so the comment block is read one line at a time.
        In a language like C or C++ this can be handled with a single read.
    </p>
    <pre class="Code">
Variables:
    Byte : Count;
    Long : FileSize;
    file : F;

Code:
    Open_File(F);                             | Open the file for read access
    FileSize = Size_of_file(F);               | Determine file size
    Seek_file (F, FileSize-128);              | Seek to start of SAUCE (Eof-128)
    Read_File (F, SAUCE);                     | Read the SAUCE record
    IF SAUCE.ID="SAUCE" THEN                  | ID bytes match "SAUCE" ?
        IF SAUCE.Comments>0 THEN              | Is there a comment block ?
            Seek_File(F, FileSize-128-(SAUCE.Comments*64)-5);
                                              | Seek to start of Comment block.
            Read_File(F, CommentID);          | Read Comment ID.
            IF CommentID="COMNT" THEN         | Comment ID matches "COMNT" ?
                FOR Count=1 to SAUCE.Comments | \ Read all comment lines.
                    Read_File(F, CommentLine) | /
                ENDFOR
            ELSE
                Invalid_Comment;              | Non fatal, No comment present.
            ENDIF
        ENDIF
    ELSE
        Invalid_SAUCE;                        | No valid SAUCE record was found.
    ENDIF
  </pre>
    <h4>
        Warning!</h4>
    <p>
        SAUCE was initially created for supporting only the ANSi and RIP formats. Since
        those formats are &lsquo;technically&rsquo; processed one character at a time, SAUCE
        almost never interferes with how a program treats the files, reading and processing
        should stop at the EOF character. Files that are treated in a similar way such as
        ASCII, PCBoard, Avatar and ANSiMations equally tend to work unaffected even in programs
        that are not SAUCE aware.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is <b>not</b> true for all the other types of files SAUCE has DataType / FileType
        values for however. Adding SAUCE to some of the other types of files may have serious
        consequences on programs using those files. For this reason I would currently advise
        against adding SAUCE to such files, unless there is a pressing reason to do so anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
        If there are any requests for extending SAUCE to support additional file types,
        such requests will only be honored if the file does not already have its own meta
        data feature and it can be proven that SAUCE can safely be added from the typical
        programs editing such files.

        A SAUCE comment block is an optional, variable sized structure that holds up to
        255 lines of additional information, each line 64 characters wide. There are as
        many comment lines as is mentioned in the Comments field of the SAUCE record. If
        the Comments field is set to 0, there should not be a comment block at all. The
        comment block has the following layout:

    <h4>
        Notes:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>You need to provide a correct value for all required fields. A non-required field
            should either be set to the correct value, or when not used should be filled with
            spaces for the Character fields, set to 0 for the Unsigned fields or filled with
            binary zeroes for the ZString field.</li>
        <li>The <a href="#RevisionHistory">revision</a> this field was introduced. Before its
            introduction, it was a filler and should have been set to binary 0. </li>
        <li>The Character type is a string of characters encoded according to code page 437
            (IBM PC / OEM ASCII). It is neither a pascal type string with a leading length byte
            nor is it a C-style string with a trailing terminator character. Any value shorter
            than the available length should be padded with spaces.
            <ul>
                <li>A Character field should be filled with spaces to indicate it is empty / unused.</li>
                <li>Example: the ID field is 5 bytes long and contains the string "SAUCE".</li>
                <li>I have seen SAUCE where Character fields were terminated with a binary 0 with the
                    remainder containing garbage. When making a SAUCE reader, it is a good idea to properly
                    handle this case. When writing SAUCE, stick with space padding.</li>
                <li>Character fields should contain only plain text, do not insert formatting codes
                    such as ansi escape codes, pcboard color codes, html tags, ...</li>
                <li>Do not assume that a viewer will display this in a particular font or even if the
                    font is fixed width or not.</li>
                <li>Prior to revision 5, the SAUCE specifications specified &lsquo;ASCII characters&rsquo;
                    which implies code page 437. There are ANSI files out there however where the artist
                    assumed an ANSI according to his native code page and also has SAUCE assumed as
                    such.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>An unsigned binary value of 1 byte (0 to 255), 2 bytes (0 to 65535) or 4 bytes (0
            to 4294967295) stored in intel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_endian#Little-endian">
                little-endian</a> format.
            <ul>
                <li>Note that the FileSize field prior to revision 5 was listed as signed. This was
                    an artefact of Turbo Pascal &ndash; a dominant programming language in the early
                    1990s &ndash; supporting a signed integer of 4 bytes but not having an unsigned
                    integer of 4 bytes. Since a file size can never be negative, it is safe to assume
                    unsigned.</li>
                <li>SAUCE prior to revision 5 only allowed SAUCE on files up to 2Gb in size, which back
                    then was hardly a problem since hard disks were typically smaller.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A C-style zero terminated string of characters encoded according to code page 437
            (IBM PC / OEM ASCII). The part of the string not used should be filled with binary
            zero. Prior to revision 00.5 this field was a filler and was expected to be set
            to all binary zero, the different approach compared to the other Character fields
            serves as extra backwards compatibility. </li>
        <li>If you read a SAUCE record with a version number your software does not support,
            do not try to interpret the rest of the SAUCE record according to the 00 version
            spec.</li>
        <li>The interpretation of the TInfo1, TInfo2, TInfo3, TInfo4, TFlags and TInfoS fields
            <a href="#FileType">are dependant on the DataType and FileType</a> fields.</li>
        <li>FileSize was required in SAUCE prior to revision 5, it is now optional to be more
            in line with established reality. Many SAUCEd files have an incorrectly set FileSize.
            If you need to add SAUCE to a file larger than 4Gb, set FileSize equal to 0.</li>

    <h4>
        Notes:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>A 0 here means the value should always be set to zero, otherwise it can optionally
            contain the matching value.</li>
        <li>A 0 here means the field should be set to all binary zeroes, otherwise it can optionally
            contain a a set of flags.</li>
        <li>The width in characters the screen or window should be set to in order to properly
            display the file. A value of 0 means no width was provided and you should use an
            appropriate default (usually 80).</li>
        <li>Either 0 or the number of lines the file occupies when fully rendered. Some ANSI
            files have incorrect values for this, having the screen height instead. You could
            use the value as a guide for preallocating a rendering buffer. Do not assume the
            value is correct, the actual number of screen lines could be lower or higher.</li>
        <li>For ANSI-animations to render and animate properly, they require the rendering window
            to be set to a specific size. Without this, the scrolling and absolute positioning
            may not work as intended and cause the animation to be garbled. When omitted, it
            is probably a good idea to assume a 80 by 25 character window. </li>
        <li>The number of bits for each pixel. A monochrome image has 1 bit per pixel. 16 and
            256 color images have 4 and 8 bits per pixel respectively, possibly assisted by
            a palette to select colors from a larger color set. Truecolor images are 24 bit.
            A 32 bit image typically means a truecolor image with an alpha transparency component.
            While there are currently bitmap formats that allow for even larger pixel depths.
            None of them are currently provided for via SAUCE. Some image formats have a fixed
            number of colors, others are variable.</li>
        <li>The sampling rate the sample was recorded at.</li>
        <li>The BinaryText datatype does not have a file type, instead the FileType field is
            used to encode the width of the image. In order to maximize the possible range of
            widths, the width is halved allowing the FileType to specify any even width up to
            510 (255*2) characters. Odd sizes are not supported, but this was never a real problem
            because video cards also only allowed even widths.<br />
            Set the FileType to half the character width of the image, the height of the image
            can then be inferred by the formula:<br />
            <span class="Formula">Character Height = ( File size - SAUCE information<sub>(SAUCE
                record, comment block and EOF byte)</sub> ) / (FileType * 2 * 2<sub>(Character / attribute
                    pairs)</sub>)</span></li>

        These bits are interpreted as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>B: Non-blink mode (iCE Color).<br />
            When 0, only the 8 low intensity colors are supported for the character background.
            The high bit set to 1 in each attribute byte results in the foreground color blinking
            repeatedly.<br />
            When 1, all 16 colors are supported for the character background. The high bit set
            to 1 in each attribute byte selects the high intensity color instead of blinking.
        </li>
        <li>LS: Letter-spacing (a.k.a. 8/9 pixel font selection). Introduced in Version 00.5<br />
            Fixed-width text mode as used in DOS and early graphics based computers such as
            the Amiga used bitmap fonts to display text. Letter-spacing and line spacing is
            a part of the font bitmap, so the font box inside each bitmap was a bit smaller
            than the font bitmap.<br />
            For the VGA, IBM wanted a smoother font. 2 more lines were added, and the letter-spacing
            was removed from the font and instead inserted by the VGA hardware during display.
            All 8 pixels in the font could thus be used, and still have a 1 pixel letter spacing.
            For the line graphics characters, this was a problem because they needed to match
            up with their neighbours on both sides. The VGA hardware was wired to duplicate
            the 8th column of the font bitmap for the character range C0h to DFh. In some code
            pages was undesired, so this feature could be turned off to get an empty letter
            spacing on all characters as well (via the ELG field (Enable Line Graphics Character
            Codes) in the Mode Control register (10h) of the VGA Attribute Controller (3C0h).
            While the VGA allows you to enable or disable the 8th column duplication, there
            is no way to specify which range of characters this needs to be done for, the C0h
            to DFh range is hardwired into the VGA.
            <br />
            These 2 bits can be used to select the 8 pixel or 9 pixel variant of a particular
            font:
            <ul>
                <li>00: Legacy value. No preference.</li>
                <li>01: Select 8 pixel font.</li>
                <li>10: Select 9 pixel font.</li>
                <li>11: Not currently a valid value.</li>
            </ul>
            Changing the font width and wanting to remain at 80 characters per row means that
            you need to adjust for a change in horizontal resolution (from 720 pixels to 640
            or vice versa). When you are trying to match the original aspect ratio (see the
            AR bits), you will need to adjust the vertical stretching accordingly.<br />
            Only the VGA (and the Hercules) video cards actually supported fonts 9 pixels wide.
            SAUCE does not prevent you from specifying you want a 9 pixel wide font for a font
            that technically was never used that way. Note that duplicating the 8th column on
            non-IBM fonts (and even some code pages for IBM fonts) may not give the desired
            effect.<br />
            Some people like the 9 pixel fonts, some do not because it causes a visible break
            in the 3 &lsquo;shadow blocks&rsquo; (B0h, B1h and B2h) </li>
        <li>AR: Aspect Ratio. Introduced in Version 00.5<br />
            Most modern display devices have square pixels, but that has not always been the
            case. Displaying an ANSI file that was created for one of the older devices on a
            device with square pixels will vertically compress the image slightly. This can
            be compensated for by either taking a font that is slightly taller than was used
            on the legacy device, or by stretching the rendered image.<br />
            These 2 bits can be used to signal that the image was created with square pixels
            in mind, or that it was created for a legacy device with the elongated pixels:
            <ul>
                <li>00: Legacy value. No preference.</li>
                <li>01: Image was created for a legacy device. When displayed on a device with square
                    pixels, either the font or the image needs to be stretched.</li>
                <li>10: Image was created for a modern device with square pixels. No stretching is desired
                    on a device with square pixels.</li>
                <li>11: Not currently a valid value.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        <a id="FontName">FontName</a></h2>
    <p>
        The FontName field allows an author of ANSi and similar files to provide a clue
        to the viewer / editor which font to use to render the image.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prior to revision 00.5, this field was a filler, so this field will be empty for
        legacy files. Supplying a font name is not required.

        Notes:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The font name the author designed the artwork for. Since these are typically bitmapped
            fonts that only support 256 characters, these fonts have a fixed size and are designed
            with a specific use in mind. Characters in the range 32-127 tend to follow the ASCII
            encoding which is now also the basis of the same range in Unicode. Control characters
            in the range 0 to 31 are typically not displayable in text mode formats like ANSI
            files and require more direct access to the hardware to get them displayed. The
            visual appearance of these control characters is not part of the ASCII standard.
            Characters in the range 128-255 are different for each font. For the IBM PC, IBM
            designed their own encoding which later became known as code page 437. Some other
            systems (Amiga, C64, ...) used their own encoding for the high characters that did
            not follow the IBM code page convention. If you do not support a particular font
            in this list, either fallback to an appropriate less specific definition of the
            same font, or fallback to whatever default font your program supports.<br />
            As a simple but effective fallback strategy for the IBM family of fonts:
            <ul>
                <li>If you do not support the <span class="Code">VGA25G</span>, <span class="Code">VGA50</span>
                    or <span class="Code">EGA43</span> variant of a font, fallback to the <span class="Code">
                        VGA</span> or <span class="Code">EGA</span> variant. (string-replace <span class="Code">
                            "VGA50"</span> and <span class="Code">"VGA25G"</span> with <span class="Code">"VGA"</span>
                    and <span class="Code">"EGA43"</span> with <span class="Code">"EGA"</span>)</li>
                <li>If you do not support <span class="Code">EGA</span> fonts, fallback to the matching
                    <span class="Code">VGA</span> variant and vice versa. (string-replace <span class="Code">
                        "EGA"</span> with <span class="Code">"VGA"</span> or vice versa).</li>
                <li>Code page <span class="Code">872</span> and <span class="Code">855</span> are mostly
                    interchangeable (only different for the euro sign).</li>
                <li>Code page <span class="Code">858</span> and <span class="Code">850</span> are mostly
                    interchangeable (only different for the euro sign).</li>
                <li>Code page <span class="Code">865</span> and <span class="Code">437</span> are mostly
                    interchangeable (9Bh &lsquo;&rsquo; replacing &lsquo;&rsquo; and 9Dh &lsquo;&rsquo;
                    replacing &lsquo;&rsquo;).</li>
                <li>If you do not support the specific code page, fallback to default variant. (remove
                    <span class="Code">" ###"</span> from the end of the string)</li>
                <li>Fallback to whatever font your program uses as default.</li>
            </ul>
            For the Amiga family of fonts:
            <ul>
                <li>If you do not support the <span class="Code">"+"</span> version of a font, fallback
                    to the normal version. (remove the <span class="Code">"+"</span> from the string)</li>
                <li>If you do not support the custom font, fallback to <span class="Code">Amiga Topaz
                    1</span></li>
                <li>Fallback to whatever font your program uses as default.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The screen resolution the font was intended for.</li>
        <li>The aspect ratio is the ratio of the width of a shape to its height. The aspect
            ratio is expressed as two numbers separated by a colon (width:height). These values
            do not express an actual measurement, they represent the relation between width
            and height. If the width is larger than the height the shape has a &ldquo;landscape&rdquo;
            orientation. Width equal to height gives a square. Width smaller than height gives
            a &ldquo;portrait&rdquo; orientation. </li>
        <li>The aspect ratio of the display device the font was intended for. Up until around
            2003 the common display device was either a CRT computer monitor or a CRT TV which
            usually had a display aspect ratio of 4:3, and occasionally 5:4. Those formats are
            being replaced by &ldquo;widescreen&rdquo; displays commonly having a 16:10 or 16:9
            aspect ratio. </li>
        <li>Modern display devices (LCD, LED and plasma) tend to have square pixels or at least
            as near square as is technically feasible, because square pixels make it easy to
            draw squares and circles. For various technical reasons square pixels have not always
            been the norm however.<br />
            The downside of this is that if one tries to display an image or font on a display
            with a different aspect ratio than it was intended for, the image will appear to
            be stretched or compressed. All the old display modes tended to have a pixels that
            were taler than they were wide, so they will appear compressed vertically on a display
            with a 1:1 pixel aspect ratio.<br />
            You can compensate for this compression by stretching the image, but this will introduce
            pixelation when you just duplicate pixel lines or blurring when you apply anti-aliassing
            or interpolation.<br />
            Similar to trying to display a 4:3 TV signal on a widescreen display, some people
            will prefer the compressed but &lsquo;native pixel&rsquo; sharpness, and others
            will prefer the native dimension and accept the loss in sharpness.<br />
            The pixel aspect ratio is obtained by dividing the display aspect ratio width by
            the horizontal resolution and dividing the display aspect ratio height by the vertical
            resolution and then reducing both sides of the ratio. </li>
        <li>The stretching percentage that needs to be applied to the composed bitmap so that
            its relative size matches the original device it was intended for. The actual calculation
            for this stretch percentage would normally involve knowing the current display aspect
            ratio as well as the resolution. However since most modern screens have a 1:1 aspect
            ratio, this can simplified to:<br />
            <span class="Formula">((pixel aspect ratio height / pixel aspect ratio width) - 1) *
                100</span><br />
            Or alternatively:<br />
            <span class="Formula">(((display aspect height / y-resolution) / (display aspect width
                / x-resolution)) -1) * 100</span></li>
        <li>9 pixel fonts. to be completed</li>
        <li>The <span class="Code">&ldquo;###&rdquo;</span> is a placeholder, these 3 characters
            should be replaced by one of the code pages IBM/Microsoft defined for use in DOS.
            The possible values for code page <span class="Code"><i>###</i></span> are:
            <ul>

        <li>The Amiga 500 typically works at a 640&times;200 resolution or 640&times;400 in
            interlaced mode on NTSC monitor (USA and Japan), and at 640&times;256 (640&times;512
            interlaced) on PAL monitors (most of Europe). In interlaced mode, rather than condensing
            the font to achieve double the amount of lines of text, the font instead was stretched
            to double its size.<br />
            It is not uncommon to now find programs using a pre-stretched 816 font for displaying
            Amiga ANSI files. In that case, the pixel ratio mentioned here should be adjusted
            accordingly to 5:6 (1:1.2) and the vertical stretching to 20%</li>
        <li>This font was used in a 40&times;25 character mode. It may be necessary to double
            the size of the font or image to get the "chunky" look.</li>
